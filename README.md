# TaskTracker

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.1.4.
To test the exercise please run `npm install` and then `npm start`.
Once it finishes compiling open http://localhost:4200/ in your browser.

## Excercise Description

Exercise: Task tracker   
Please develop a small SPA with this simple requirements:   
* Present visually a list of tasks in 3 different states: Planned, In progress, Completed.   
* Each task contains, name, description, estimate and state.   
* The user needs to be able to add/remove and change the state of the tasks.  
* Somewhere in the SPA you need to present an up to date status, adding up all hours for each state.  
Notes:   
You can assume it's a single user SPA, and there's no need to store data; but the user needs to be able to add/remove and see tasks.  

Mocking a REST api is suggested.   
You can reuse any existing library, but please distribute the solution with them.   
Write code as you would for production, having in mind that usability is important as well.   
Use of Angular > v2


## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
